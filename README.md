# modified_cartpole
This repository is about the modified version of Cart Pole environment.

There are 2 main modifications: action shaping and reward shaping. In the action shaping, the agent has 3 possible actions (left, stable, and right) instead of 2 (left and right). In the reward shaping, the agent is punished if it uses force (left or right).

The logs folder contains data about the learning process. The models folder contains the models saved during the learning process. The results folder contains the actions taken by the best learned model and their results (taken steps, and gained rewards).Â 

The Modified_CartPole pdf file explains the details of this work.
